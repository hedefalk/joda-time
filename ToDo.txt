JodaTime ToDo list
==================

1.0
---
Duration:
 Write tests
 
Interval:
 Write classes
 Write formatters/parsers
 Write tests
 
Tests:
 Write tests to cover functionality
 Ensure all tests pass!

Serializable:
 Tests
 
DateOnly/TimeOnly:
 Enable DateTimeProperty

Consistency:
 Check API for design and naming consistency
 eg. withXxx() vs toXxx() vs asXxx vs toCopyXxx()
 
 Chronology: withUTC(), withDateTimeZone()
 AbstractInstant: toCopy()
 DateTimeProperty: addToCopy(), setCopy(), ...
 DurationSupport: withChronology()
 

Ideas longer term
-----------------
Factories for DateTime clases?
 Is a locale dependent one needed at least?

More chronologies:
 Implement more chronologies, like ChineseChronology, HebrewChronology,
 PersianChronology, etc. This may require more work in localization.

Chronology:
 Add daysFrom(year)
 This would be a DateTimeField that, given a base year, returns the number of
 elapsed days from 1st Jan that year. Apparantly useful for Excel, where a
 standard format is days from 1900.

ISOCalendar:
 Calendar subclass that implements our interface. This might be difficult to
 do since Calendar has so many final methods and a rigid specification.

ISODate:
 Date subclasses that implements our interface. This might not be a worthwhile
 effort since almost all Date methods are deprecated.

Recurrence:
 Create a set of classes for supporting recurrences. This will need to support
 complex specifications such as "2nd Wednesday in May" and "next Thursday".
 A builder design might be helpful.

Holidays:
 These can simply be special instances of Recurrences.
