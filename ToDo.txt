Ideas longer term
-----------------
- Pluggable text providers:
   Allow all text output to be controlled and updated.
   Probably use the CLDR files.

- More chronologies:
   Implement more chronologies, like ChineseChronology, HebrewChronology,
   PersianChronology, etc. This may require more work in localization.

- DateTimeFormatter.appendLocaleFormatterMap(map):
    Adds a map of Locale to Formatter, which picks the formatter to use
    based on the locale of the print/parse. Allows for the flexible insertion
    of any locale based text into a shared multi-language formatter.

- DateTimeField.setNext(instant, value, howManyNext):
    Allows questions like what is the date next Tuesday

- Partial matching:
    Add code to allow full matching of partials. Thus you might define
    DayOfWeek=Friday and DayOfMonth=13, and then resolve to find the
    next matching Friday the 13th.

- DateHourMinute/DateHourMinuteSecond/YearMonth?
    More instant variations
    May be covered by Partial class now

- LocalDateTime/LocalDate/LocalTime?
    Possible alternative implementation of contiguous partials

- DurationProperty on DateTime, Period and related?
    Possibly a clear way to do duration stuff, however adding plusDays() type
    methods might be simpler.

- Factories for DateTime classes?
    Perhaps, but the constructors cover this now.

- ChronologyType:
    An enumerated type for chronologies to replace the static methods on Chronology
    This will also help with serialization

- Chronology:
    Add daysFrom(year)
    This would be a DateTimeField that, given a base year, returns the number of
    elapsed days from 1st Jan that year. Apparantly useful for Excel, where a
    standard format is days from 1900.

- ISOCalendar:
    Calendar subclass that implements our interface. This might be difficult to
    do since Calendar has so many final methods and a rigid specification.

- ISODate:
    Date subclasses that implements our interface. This might not be a worthwhile
    effort since almost all Date methods are deprecated.

- Recurrence:
    Create a set of classes for supporting recurrences. This will need to support
    complex specifications such as "2nd Wednesday in May" and "next Thursday".
    A builder design might be helpful.

- Holidays:
    These might simply be special instances of Recurrences.
