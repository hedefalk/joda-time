Joda-Time version 1.6
---------------------

Joda-Time is a date and time handling library that seeks to replace the JDK
Date and Calendar classes.

This is the seventh release of Joda-Time.
This release contains enhancements, bug fixes and a time zone update.

We recommend JDK 1.4 or later, and have performed no testing on earlier JDKs.

Joda-Time is licensed under the business-friendly Apache License Version 2.

The intent is to make the code available to the Java community with the minimum

Deprecations since 1.5
----------------------


Bug fixes since 1.5
-------------------
- Fixed offset time zones calculated incorrect periods
  ZonedChronology.ZonedDuration.isPrecise() did not take into account
  the decorated isPrecise() value. This meant that date fields for fixed
  offset time zones were always considered precise. The result was periods
  containing months and years when they should not have done.

- ZonedChronology (regression from 1.4) [1887104]
  Fix to roundFloor/roundCeiling
  Bug affected DST cutover in Autumn for time fields (not date fields)
  
- Clarify Javadoc time zone formats
  Time zone formats were incorrectly documented as 'Z' instead of 'ZZ'
  Javadoc only change

- DateTimeZone (regression from 1.4) [fix also available in v1.5.2]
  Fix getOffsetFromLocal DST gap adjustment
  Bug affected parsing of DST cutover in Autumn

- Parsing (regression from 1.4) [1839440] [fix also available in v1.5.1]

- Javadoc clarity enhancements [fix also available in v1.5.1]
  - Constants in Years/Months/Weeks/Days/Hours/Minutes/Seconds etc.
