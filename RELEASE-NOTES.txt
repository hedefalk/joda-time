Joda-Time version 1.0
---------------------

Joda-Time is a date and time handling library that seeks to replace the JDK Date and Calendar classes.

This is the first full release of Joda-Time.
There have been a number of alpha/beta releases however.

We now recommend JDK 1.3 or later, and have performed no testing on earlier JDKs.
