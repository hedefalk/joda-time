Joda-Time version 1.0
---------------------

Joda-Time is a date and time handling library that seeks to replace the JDK
Date and Calendar classes.

This is the first full release of Joda-Time.
There have been a number of alpha/beta releases however.

We now recommend JDK 1.3 or later, and have performed no testing on earlier JDKs.


Bug fixes since 0.98
--------------------

- Interval/MutableInterval isAfter(ReadableInterval) - fixed bug when intervals abutted

- Parsing periods of the form PT... - fixed bug that prevented parsing

- Period parsing now more strict - 'T' character required to separate date and
  time in ISO periods

- Fixed parsing of fractional seconds in Periods

- Default time zone based on offset was being interpreted as UTC

- Fixed NullPointerException in DateTimeFormat

- DateTimeFormat would use date style for time style

New features since 0.98
-----------------------

- Added support to create periods from a duration and an end instant

- Periods can be converted to durations by end instant too

- Durations can be converted to periods by end instant too

- Durations can be converted to intervals by end instant too
