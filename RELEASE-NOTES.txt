Joda-Time version 1.1
---------------------

Joda-Time is a date and time handling library that seeks to replace the JDK
Date and Calendar classes.

This is the second full release of Joda-Time.

We recommend JDK 1.3 or later, and have performed no testing on earlier JDKs.

Joda-Time is licensed under the business-friendly Apache License Version 2.
This is the same license as all of Apache, plus other open source projects such as Spring.
The intent is to make the code available to the Java community with the minimum
of restrictions. If the license cause you problems please contact the mailing list.

None


Bug fixes since 1.0
-------------------
- DateTimeFormat
  Parsing of two digit year by DateTimeFormat supports parsing of more or less
  than two digits, for compatibility with java.text.SimpleDateFormat. If not
  two digits or if sign character is present, then year is parsed as absolute.

- ZoneInfoCompiler
  Comment parsing bug disabled DST for Europe/Athens after 1980.

Enhancements since 1.0
----------------------
- YearMonthDay/TimeOfDay
  Enabled comparisons using Comparable interface
  Added compareTo/isEqual/isAfter/isBefore methods
  
- YearMonthDay/TimeOfDay
  Extra time zone constructor
  Allows current date and time to be accurately obtained

- DateTime/DateMidnight/MutableDateTime/YearMonthDay/TimeOfDay Property
  Added new method to property class - getAsString()
  Gets the value as a string, not using text values like 'Monday' or 'January'

- Period
  Added constructors to create a Period from two ReadablePartials, such as
  YearMonthDay or TimeOfDay

- PeriodType
  Added three new period types - YearMonthDay, YearWeekDay and YearDay
  These complement the existing ones but exclude the time fields.

- DateTimeFormatter
  Method withPivotYear added to allow the two digit pivot year to be controlled.
  This is most useful after creating a format from a string pattern.

- DateTimeFormatter
  Added lenient parse option to appendTwoDigitYear and appendTwoDigitWeekyear.

- Interval
  Added overlap method that returns the actual overlap between two intervals.

- DateTimeZone classes updated to latest data from the Olsen time zone database
