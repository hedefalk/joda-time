Joda-Time version 0.95
----------------------

This version of Joda-Time is the first released from the new home of joda-time.sourceforge.net.
The API has had many details tidied up, and performance tweaked.
It also has a Duration class again, complete with parser and formatter.

The code is accurate as far as we know, however the tests could still do with work.
So, if you would like to help out in any way, let us know.
