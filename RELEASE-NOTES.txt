Joda-Time version 1.1
---------------------

Joda-Time is a date and time handling library that seeks to replace the JDK
Date and Calendar classes.

This is the second full release of Joda-Time.

We recommend JDK 1.3 or later, and have performed no testing on earlier JDKs.

Joda-Time is licensed under the business-friendly Apache License Version 2.
This is the same license as all of Apache, plus other open source projects such as Spring.
The intent is to make the code available to the Java community with the minimum
of restrictions. If the license cause you problems please contact the mailing list.

- PeriodType
  Added three new period types - YearMonthDay, YearWeekDay and YearDay
  These complement the existing ones but exclude the time fields.

  This is most useful after creating a format from a string pattern.
