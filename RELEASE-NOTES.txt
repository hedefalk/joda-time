Joda-Time version 1.5
---------------------

Joda-Time is a date and time handling library that seeks to replace the JDK
Date and Calendar classes.

This is the sixth full release of Joda-Time.
This release focuses on new features, but also include some bug fixes.

We recommend JDK 1.3 or later, and have performed no testing on earlier JDKs.

Joda-Time is licensed under the business-friendly Apache License Version 2.
This is the same license as all of Apache, plus other open source projects such as Spring.
The intent is to make the code available to the Java community with the minimum
of restrictions. If the license causes you problems please contact the mailing list.

Bug fixes since 1.4
-------------------
- LocalDate/LocalTime constructors did not set internal state correctly
  This problem was exposed when Days.daysBetween() and similar methods
  failed to give the right results

- ZoneInfoProvider now returns a copy of its internal state on getAvailableIDs
  This avoids race conditions on some JVMs

- Period formating threw NegativeArraySizeException during formatting
  This happened for certain period values, notably zero
