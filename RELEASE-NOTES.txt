Joda-Time version 1.3
---------------------

Joda-Time is a date and time handling library that seeks to replace the JDK
Date and Calendar classes.

This is the fourth full release of Joda-Time.
This release focuses on bug fixes, with a few new features.

We recommend JDK 1.3 or later, and have performed no testing on earlier JDKs.

Joda-Time is licensed under the business-friendly Apache License Version 2.
This is the same license as all of Apache, plus other open source projects such as Spring.
The intent is to make the code available to the Java community with the minimum
of restrictions. If the license causes you problems please contact the mailing list.

** Please also check out the JSP and Hibernate contributed projects **

Deprecations since 1.2
----------------------

    These were identical to the methods without the ISO suffix


Bug fixes since 1.2
-------------------
- DateTime/DateMidnight/MutableDateTime/AbstractInstant
   Conversion methods toDateTime, toDateTimeISO, toMutableDateTime, and
    toMutableDateTimeISO now preserve the time zone.
    Previously calling any of these four methods would convert the result to
    the default time zone. This was incorrect.
    The methods have been changed to preserve the time zone.
   The similarly named methods on Instant have not changed behaviour.

- Interval/MutableInterval.overlaps(ReadableInterval)
  Previously, this method didn't handle empty intervals correctly
  Now, an empty interval at the start of a larger interval does overlap

- DateTimeFormatterBuilder.MatchingParser
  Previously didn't estimate parsed length correctly

- YearMonthDay/TimeOfDay/Partial.Property
  Hashcode was not defined

- FixedDateTimeZone
  Hashcode was not defined

- ISO/Gregorian/Julian/Coptic/EthiopicChronology
  Fixed overflow when getting year field from instants at Long.MAX_VALUE and
  LONG.MIN_VALUE.
