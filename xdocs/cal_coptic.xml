<section name="Coptic calendar system">

<p>
The Coptic calendar system implemented in Joda-time is as follows.
Years are defined as per the <a href="cal_julian.html">Julian</a> calendar system,
that is once every four years.
The year is broken down into 12 months, each of exactly 30 days in length.
An extra period at the end of the year is either 5 or 6 days in length (depending on whether it is a leap year).
Joda-time defines this period as a 13th month.
</p>
<p>
Year 1 in the Coptic calendar began on August 29, 284 CE (Julian), thus
Coptic years do not begin at the same time as Julian years.
The implementation is not proleptic, as it does not allow dates before the first Coptic year.

<section name="Using Coptic chronology in Joda-time">
<p>
Within Joda-Time the Coptic calendar system can be used by obtaining an
instance of <a href="apidocs/org/joda/time/chrono/CopticChronology.html">CopticChronology</a>.
This is normally created using the factory method
<a href="apidocs/org/joda/time/Chronology.html#getCoptic()">Chronology.getCoptic()</a>.
This is then passed into the constructors of the main date and time classes.

// setup date object for midday on Christmas 2004 (ISO year 2004)
DateTime dtISO = new DateTime(2004, 12, 25, 12, 0, 0, 0);
DateTime dtCopt = dtISO.withChronology(Chronology.getCoptic());
