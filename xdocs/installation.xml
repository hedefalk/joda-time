<p>
To use Joda-Time you need to
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=97367&amp;package_id=104212">download the latest version</a>.
The download will contain the joda-time-1.1.jar. Once you add this to your classpath you will be able to use Joda-Time.
</p>
<!--<p>
As from v1.1 we release three versions:
<ul>
<li>ide - the recommended download for most Eclipse/IDEA/NetBeans users.
  This contains the binary jar file and a zip of the java source files to attach within your IDE classpath.</li>
<li>bin - the classic binary release, with the jar file and javadocs</li>
<li>src - the classic source release, with the jar file and all source files</li>
</ul>
</p>-->
<p>
The release notes for upgraders can be found here:
<ul>
<li><a href="upgradeto110.html">Version 1.0 to Version 1.1</a></li>
<li><a href="upgradeto100.html">Version 0.99 to Version 1.0</a></li>
<li><a href="upgradeto099.html">Version 0.98 to Version 0.99</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If you want to build Joda-Time from source you will need
<a href="http://ant.apache.org">Apache Ant</a>.
Simply call <code>ant jar</code> to compile and create a jar file.
</p>
<p>
Compilation is also available using
<a href="http://maven.apache.org">Apache Maven</a>.
Maven is intended to be used primarily as a website generation tool.
Ant is our preferred build tool.

<section name="Eclipse Support">
<p>
If you use Eclipse as your IDE and want to integrate the Joda-Time help files
into the eclipse documentation tree, you need to download and install the
<a href="">Joda-Time documentation plugin</a>.
</p>
<p>
In addition, if you <em>are developing Eclipse plugins</em> (i.e. using the PDE),
you may choose to use the <a href="">Joda-Time plugin</a>. This is a wrapper
around
the Joda-Time jar which allows a single copy of the Joda-Time jar to be used
by all installed plugins. It needs to be available on both the development
and the run-time machine.
</p>
<p>
In addition you may also want the <a href="">Joda-Time source plugin</a>.
This is a wrapper for the joda time sources to make them visible to the Eclipse
PDE. It only needs to be made available on the development machine.
