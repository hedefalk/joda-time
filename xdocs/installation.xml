<section name="Download and Installation">
<p>
You can download the latest version of Joda-Time
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=97367&amp;package_id=104212">here</a>.
Once the "joda-time.jar" is in your classpath, you will be able to use Joda-Time.
</p>
<p>
Unless you have a specific reason to do otherwise, it is advisable to use the
binary download. If you want to build Joda-Time from source you will need
<a href="http://ant.apache.org">Apache Ant</a>.
Simply call <code>ant jar</code> to compile and create a jar file.

<section name="Eclipse Support">
<p>
If you use Eclipse as your IDE and want to integrate the Joda-Time help files
into the eclipse documentation tree, you need to download and install the
<a href="">Joda-Time documentation plugin</a>.
</p>
<p>
In addition, if you <em>are developing Eclipse plugins</em> (i.e. using the PDE),
you may choose to use the <a href="">Joda-Time plugin</a>. This is a wrapper
around
the Joda-Time jar which allows a single copy of the Joda-Time jar to be used
by all installed plugins. It needs to be available on both the development
and the run-time machine.
</p>
<p>
In addition you may also want the <a href="">Joda-Time source plugin</a>.
This is a wrapper for the joda time sources to make them visible to the Eclipse
PDE. It only needs to be made available on the development machine.
