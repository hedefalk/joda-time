<section name="Joda Time Distribution">
<p>
Unless you have a specific reason to do otherwise, you should work with the
pre-built <a href="">joda-time distribution</a>. Building the entire distribution
from the CVS sources requires a maven installation, and is not (as yet)
completely straightforward. Once the "joda-time.jar" is in your classpath,
you will be able to use joda-time.

<section name="Eclipse Support">
<p>
If you use Eclipse as your IDE and want to integrate the joda-time help files
into the eclipse documentation tree, you need to download and install the
<a href="">joda-time documentation plugin</a>.
</p>
<p>
In addition, if you <em>are developing Eclipse plugins</em> (i.e. using the PDE),
you may choose to use the <a href="">joda-time plugin</a>. This is a wrapper
around
the joda-time jar which allows a single copy of the joda-time jar to be used
by all installed plugins. It needs to be available on both the development
and the run-time machine.
</p>
<p>
In addition you may also want the <a href="">joda-time source plugin</a>.
This is a wrapper for the joda time sources to make them visible to the Eclipse
PDE. It only needs to be made available on the development machine.
