<section name="GregorianJulian (GJ) calendar system">

<p>
Joda-Time provides a quality replacement for the Java date and time classes.
The calendar system most commonly used for historical work is the GregorianJulian or GJ.
This corresponds to the JDK <code>GregorianCalendar</code> class.
</p>

<p>
The GregorianJulian calendar is a combination of two separate calendar systems.
The switch from one to the other occurs at a configurable date.
The default date is 1582-10-15, as defined by Pope Gregory XIII, working with the Council of Trent.
</p>

<p>
The two calendar systems differ mainly in their accuracy of recording leap years.
The Julian calendar defines a leap year as being once every four years.
The Gregorian calendar adds two extra rules to state that years divisible by 100 are not leap, but those divisible by 400 are.
</p>

<p>
Within Joda-Time this calendar system can be used by obtaining an instance of
<a href="apidocs/org/joda/time/chrono/GJChronology.html">GJChronology</a>.
This is then passed into the constructors of the main date and time classes.
</p>
<source>
// setup date object for the Battle of Hastings in 1066
Chronology chrono = GJChronology.getInstance();
DateTime dt = new DateTime(1066, 10, 14, 10, 0, 0, 0, chrono);
