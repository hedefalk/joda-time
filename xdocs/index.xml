<b>Joda Dates is a Java open-source project to rewrite the Java Date and Calendar classes.</b>
</p>

<p>
Date and Time handling is fundamental to many applications.
However, the classes supplied in Java have always been weak.
Date should have been immutable, like String.
Instead, it has many deprecated methods.
Calendar makes accessing 'normal' dates difficult, due to the lack of simple methods.
Calendar also has some strange performance characteristics. 
</p>

<p>
The Joda Dates project seeks to provide an implementation of dates and times for the Java community.
The 'default' calendar system implemented will be the ISO8601 standard.
This specifies a framework for date and time management independent of locale.
Thus, in the standard, the first day of the week is Monday, and this has the index 1.
This avoids any ambiguity accross national boundaries.
</p>

<p>
Additional calendar systems supported are Gregorian, Julian, GregorianJulian (GJ) and Buddhist.
The design is flexible and pluggable, so adding additional calendar systems should be easy. 
</p>

<p>
Using a Joda date you can write:
</p>
<pre>
  DateTime dt = new DateTime();
  int year = dt.getYear();
  String monthText = dt.monthOfYear().getAsText();
</pre>
<p>
And this is only a flavour of what is available, see the <a href="apidocs/index.html">API</a> for more detail.
</p>

<p>
Current interfaces and implementations include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Instant</li>
<li>DateTime</li>
<li>DateOnly</li>
<li>TimeOnly</li>
<li>Duration</li>
<li>DateTimeZone</li>
<li>...plus formatting and parsing</li>
</ul>

<p>
Joda Time is licenced under the <a href="license.html">Joda licence</a>,
which is an Apache/BSD cloned licence.
