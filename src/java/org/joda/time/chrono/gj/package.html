<h3>Gregorian/Julian Chronology.</h3>
<p>
The Gregorian/Julian calendar system (shortened to GJ) is the most commonly used 
system on the planet. The Julian system defined a leap year once every 4 years, whereas
the Gregorian calendar has additional special rules for every 100 and 400 years.
This package provides the classes necessary to support the GJ calendar system, including
different cutover dates, the presence or absence of a year zero, an all Gregorian calendar
or an all Julian calendar.
