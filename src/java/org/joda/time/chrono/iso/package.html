<h3>ISO Chronology</h3>
<p>
The ISO calendar system is that defined by the ISO8601 standard. It is in fact a special
case of the Gregorian calendar system. It is defined as Gregorian over all time (proleptic)
and includes the year 0 (which never actually occurred). All XML date and time transfers
are recommended to use the ISO8601 standard.
