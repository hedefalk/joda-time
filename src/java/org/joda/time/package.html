<p>
Provides support for dates, times, time zones, durations, and intervals. This
package aims to fully replace the Java Date, Calendar, and TimeZone
classes. This implementation covers both the Gregorian/Julian calendar system
and the ISO8601 standard. Additional calendar systems and extensions can be
created as well.
</p>
<p>
The ISO8601 standard is the international standard for dates, times, durations,
and intervals. It defines text representations, the first day of the week as
Monday, and the first week in a year as having a Thursday in it. This standard
is being increasingly used in computer interchange and is the agreed format for
XML. For most uses, the ISO standard is the same as Gregorian, and is thus the
preferred format.
</p>

<h4>Interfaces</h4>
<p>
The main API concepts are defined by interfaces:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ReadableInstant</code> - an instant in time
<li><code>ReadableDateTime</code> - an instant in time with field accessors
<li><code>ReadableDuration</code> - a duration broken down into fields
<li><code>ReadableInterval</code> - a period of time between two instants
</ul>
<ul>
<li><code>ReadWritableInstant</code> - an instant that can be modified
<li><code>ReadWritableDateTime</code> - a datetime that can be modified
<li><code>ReadWritableDuration</code> - a duration that can be modified
<li><code>ReadWritableInterval</code> - an interval that can be modified
</ul>
<p>
These define the public interface to dates, times, and durations. As with
java.util.Date and Calendar, the design is millisecond based with an epoch of
1970-01-01. This should enable easy conversions.
</p>

<h4>Implementations</h4>
<p>
The basic implementation of the <code>ReadableInstant</code> interface is
<code>Instant</code>. This is a simple immutable class that stores the
millisecond value and integrates with Java Date and Calendar. If you are
dealing with an instant in time but do not know, or do not want to specify,
which calendar system it refers to, then you should use this class.
</p>
<p>
The main implementation class for datetimes is the <code>DateTime</code> class.
This implements the <code>ReadableDateTime</code> interface, providing
convenient methods to access the fields of the datetime. Conversion methods
allow integration with the Java Date and Calendar classes.
</p>
<p>
Like <code>Instant</code>, <code>DateTime</code> is <i>immutable</i>, and it
can be used safely in a multi-threaded environment. Most of the methods in
<code>DateTime</code> are final, but the class itself is not. Subclasses of
<code>DateTime</code> can actually be mutable, but they cannot alter the values
returned by the standard <code>DateTime</code> or superclass methods.
</p>
<p>
To be fully immutable <code>DateTime</code> would have to be final, but that
prevents subclasses from adding convenient access methods. Choosing this design
allows the flexibility of convenience, but at the risk of someone writing
potentially mutable subclasses. (Note that the internal data values cannot be
modified, so the "danger" posed is small.)
</p>
<p>
In addition to the datetime classes, there are date and time only classes, 
<code>DateOnly</code> and <code>TimeOnly</code>. These have similar subclasses 
to <code>DateTime</code>.
</p>
<p>
The concrete implementations of the <code>ReadWritable...</code> interfaces are
named the same as their immutable counterparts, but with a "Mutable"
prefix. For example, <code>MutableDateTime</code> implements
<code>ReadWritableDateTime</code>, making datetime editing easy.
</p>

<h4>User defined APIs</h4>
<p>
User defined methods should generally accept instants and durations specified
by one of the interfaces. This allows the method to accept more types, and it
clearly states what operations it requires. A method that declares an input
parameter of type <code>ReadWritableDateTime</code> is declaring that the
object will get updated.
</p>
<p>
The interfaces that define read operations, like <code>ReadableDateTime</code>,
only limit the allowed set of operations, but they do <i>not</i> guarantee that
the object is immutable. Care must be taken when saving a parameter of this
type. Calling a conversion method like <code>toDateTime</code> beforehand
guarantees immutability of the saved object, but does not add any significant
overhead if the object was already a DateTime.
</p>
<p>
User defined methods that return instants or durations should generally declare
a concrete return type, like <code>DateTime</code>. Again, the interfaces only
define permitted operations. Since <code>DateTime</code> is guaranteed
immutable, callers of the method know that the returned object can be safely
shared and accessed by multiple threads.
</p>

<h4>Chronologies and Fields</h4>
<p>
In order to enable the package to be easily extended, each field of the
datetime, such as the month, is calculated by an implementation of
<code>DateTimeField</code>. Likewise, duration fields are calculated by
specialized <code>DurationField</code> instances. If desired, users can write
their own implementations to retrieve an unusual field from the millisecond
value.
</p>
<p>
The datetime and duration fields that together represent a calendar system are
grouped into a <code>Chronology</code>. The chronology represents all the
information to convert from a millisecond value to human understandable fields
in a specific calendar system. Chronologies are provided for ISO and
Gregorian/Julian (GJ). (ISO is in fact a special case of GJ).
</p>
<p>
This design results in a low overhead on the date and time classes. Java
Calendar class performs poorly because it has many internal fields that are
constantly kept in sync. This design only calculates fields when required,
resulting in lightweight and simple date time classes.
</p>

<h4>Formatting</h4>
<p>
Formatting is provided by the <code>format</code> subpackage. Comprehensive
support is provided for outputting dates and times in multiple formats. A
pattern similar to Java SimpleDateFormat can be used, but a more advanced
programmatic technique is available.
</p>

<h4>General</h4>
<p>
This package is standalone and has no dependencies other than JDK 1.2.
It is licenced under an Apache/BSD style licence.
