<h3>DateTime object creation and manipulation.</h3>
<p>
This package aims to provide a full date and time implementation to replace
the Java Date and Calendar classes. The implementation covers both the
Gregorian/Julian calendar system and the ISO8601 standard.
The design aims to be flexible enough to enable other calendar systems, or 
extensions to the provided ones, to be created.
</p>
<p>
The ISO8601 standard is the international standard for dates, times and time
periods. It defines a String representation and fixes values for the first day
of the week, Monday which has the value 1, and the first week in a year. This
standard is being increasingly used in computer interchange and is the agreed
format for XML. For most uses, the ISO standard is the same as Gregorian/Julian
and is thus the preferred format.
</p>

<h4>Interfaces</h4>
<p>
The main API concepts are defined by interfaces:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ReadableInstant</code> - an instant in time
<li><code>ReadWriteableInstant</code> - an instant that can be updated
</ul>
<p>
These define the public interface to dates and times. The design is
millisecond based as with java.util.Date and Calendar. This should enable easy
conversions.
</p>
<p>
It is intended that dates are passed into methods using the interface. Methods
will utilise the date and if necessary return a specified implementation, preferably
<code>Instant</code>. By using the interface to pass time in and <code>Instant</code>
to return time you are not hard coding a locale specific calendar system into your API.
Within the method you can create an instance of a specific calendar system to work
with if required.
</p>

<h4>Implementations</h4>
<p>
The basic implementation of the <code>ReadableInstant</code> interface is 
<code>Instant</code>. This is a simple immutable class that stores the millisecond
value and integrates with Java Date and Calendar. If you are dealing with an instant
in time but do not know, or do not want to specify, which calendar system it refers
to then you should use this class.
</p>
<p>
The main implementation class for datetimes is the <code>DateTime</code> class.
This implements the <code>ReadableInstant</code> interface, but also provides
convenient methods to access the fields of the datetime. Conversion methods allow 
integration with the Java Date and Calendar classes. <code>DateTime</code> has 
three subclasses at present - <code>ISODateTime</code>, <code>GJDateTime</code> 
and <code>BuddhistDateTime</code>. These provide the same functionality but with 
different <i>chronologies</i>.
</p>
<p>
These subclasses are <i>immutable</i>, so can be used safely in a multi-threaded
environment. <code>DateTime</code> itself can be considered to be immutable so 
long as you only use the methods it or a superclass defines. To be fully immutable
<code>DateTime</code> would have to be final, but that prevents
subclasses from adding convenient access methods. The chosen design allows the 
flexibility of convenience, but at the risk of someone writing potentially mutable
subclasses. (Note that the millisecond and chronology values are immutable, so the 
'danger' posed is small.)
</p>
<p>
In addition to the datetime classes, there are date and time only classes, 
<code>DateOnly</code> and <code>TimeOnly</code>. These have similar subclasses 
to <code>DateTime</code>.
</p>
<p>
To enable the easy editing of datetimes, there is a single implementation of the
<code>ReadWriteableInstant</code> interface, <code>MutableDateTime</code>.
</p>

<h4>Chronologies and Fields</h4>
<p>
In order to enable the package to be easily extended, each field of the datetime,
such as the month, is calculated by a separate subclass of <code>DateTimeField</code>.
If desired, applcations can then write their own implementations to retrieve an unusual 
field from the millisecond value.
</p>
<p>
The fields that together represent a calendar system are grouped into a <code>Chonology</code>.
The chronology represents all the information to convert from a millisecond value to
human understanable fields in a specific calendar system. Chronologies are provided for 
ISO and Gregorian/Julian (GJ). (ISO is in fact a special case of GJ).
</p>
<p>
This design results in a low overhead on the date time classes. Java Calendar class
performs poorly because it has many internal fields that are constantly kept in sync.
This design only calculates fields when required, resulting in lightweight and simple
date time classes.
</p>

<h4>Formatting</h4>
<p>
Formatting is provided by the <code>format</code> subpackage. Comprehensive support is
provided for outputting dates and times in multiple formats. A pattern similar to
Java SimpleDateFormat can be used, but a more advanced programmatic technique is available.
</p>

<h4>General</h4>
<p>
The package is standalone and has no dependencies other than JDK 1.2.
It is licenced under an Apache/BSD style licence.
