JodaTime ToDo list
==================

1.0
---
Durations/TimePeriods:
 Integrate new design
 Write formatter
 Write tests
 
Tests:
 Write tests to cover functionality
 Ensure all tests pass!

Serializable - need tests and serialVersionID field

BuddhistChronology:
 Code missing fields

Factories for DateTime clases? Well a locale dependent one is needed at least


Ideas longer term
-----------------
Chronology:
 Add daysFrom(year)

ISOCalendar:
 Calendar subclass that implements our interface

ISODate:
 Date subclasses that implements our interface

PartialDateTime:
 Add a partial date time class? It would allow you to have specify for example 7th Feb
 without specifying the year.
